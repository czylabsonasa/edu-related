### generate permutations with restrictions
- the absolute difference between neighbouring elements is <= 2
- via backtracking
- you can modify to see (get) the permutations
- sub-function technique: convenient/simple way to imitate 
complex datatypes (classes). The data inside the wrapper function 
is persistent, the returned function can/will access and modify them.
