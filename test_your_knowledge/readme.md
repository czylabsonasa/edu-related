### about
- some applied/numerical-math related tasks from various online-judges 
- matlab is NOT the best tool to solve (=the boot is on the wrong leg)
- use your favourite language

### what is `(X)`?
- the `(X)` sign next to a problem means that it is **NOT** available for extra points

### floating point systems/computations
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/cantor   `(X)`
  - ternary expansion, identify period
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/mortgage
  - careful analysis of the cases
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/triangle  `(X)`
  - how get the number of decimal digits in the integer part?

### matrix/vector/solving linear systems
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/equationsolver
- https://www.spoj.com/problems/MIFF   `(X)`
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/matrix   `(X)`

### kinda optimization/searching for extremal values/locations
- https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stocks-i/
  - O(n) approach expected
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/zipline
  - ternary search or other simple optimization method
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/euclideantsp
  - ternary, nothing to do with the true tsp...
  - in case of using interval based methods: how to choose the initial interval?
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/curvyblocks
  - minimal calculus knowledge + careful implementation
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/pizza
  - discrete,weighted version of the Fermat-Weber problem
  - unimodal
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/starnotatree
  - an approach similar to the "gradient descent" but without the gradient will do the job 

### polynomials
- https://open.kattis.com/problems/ada
  - kind of polynomial interpolation but can be done without constructing the polynomial
